# About the exam

* 50 questions, 90 minutes;
* You need to score 68% or higher to get the certification;

## About the questions
* The test is entirely multiple choice, but the number of alternatives may vary between 4 and 7;
* Some questions specifically state how many correct answers there are;
* Questions can be classified into five types:
  1. Questions with Extra Information: these are questions that sort of give in what they're about, like little gifts;
  2. Questions with Embedded Questions: some questions may have two problems mixed up into one single question. These are often the hardest ones, so watch out;
  3. Questions with Unfamiliar APIs: sometimes a question may contain an unfamiliar API, with classes and method calls that you never heard of. The tip here is just to asume that the block of code you don't know is working as expected, and search for errors in the rest of the code;
  4. Questions with Made-Up Concepts: some questions may bring made-up concepts, features or wording to trick you;
  5. Questions Out of Scope: in order to test new questions, Oracle may first include them in the exams as unscored questions, so they can collect metrics on how the exam takers handle them before it actually gets added to the question pool. If you find something really specific and unusual, just take the same tip as nÂº 3;

## Some tips for the test
* Always start by checking if the code compiles. After that, you proceed to understanding what the code actually does;
* Since all of the questions are multiple choice ones, you can always try to apply the proccess of elimination;
* Don't be affraid of leaving hard questions behind to save time, you can always finish them later if you have some time sparring in the end;
* **Be suspicious of strong words**: some answers may contain strong words, such as *"must"*, *"all"* and *"never"*, among others. With the complexity of the java environment, most of the rules often come with a few exceptions, so these strong words mentioned above are very likely to lead you to a mistake;
* **Take the risk**: if you are short in time and don't know the answer, it's better to just randomly assign one of the options than to leave it blank. Mistakes and blanks both count as mistakes, so it's better to just take the chance;
