# OCA-17

This repo contains the notes I've been taking in the journey to take the OCA-17 exam, together with examples, exercises and a few experiments I stumbled upon in the past few weeks. 

The main source I have been using is the book [OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 17 Developer Study Guide: Exam 1Z0-829](https://www.amazon.com/Oracle-Certified-Professional-Developer-Study/dp/1119864585), thus the notes are organized according to it's chapters. I strongly recommend this book if you intend to get the certification as well.

## Project structure

As I've stated before, the notes are organized according to the book's chapters. Each chapter became a directory containing:
* The notes themselves;
* A subdirectory called `pdf`, in wich I've placed the PDF version of the notes;
* A subdirectory called `examples`, with the Java code for the examples in the book, exercises and any other piece of code that I found it would be good to write down.
